<h2>Restaurants, Cooking, and Cuisine</h2>

    <p>Cooking has always been a big part of my life. I learned how to cook at a young age, and grew up making Swedish family recipes with my mom and my grandmother.</p>
    <p>Some of my favorite dishes to cook are Swedish meatballs, a delicious tahini kale salad, sundried tomato pasta, roasted Brussels sprouts, and pesto salmon.</p>
    <p>In addition to cooking, I love to try new restaurants, both near and far.</p>
    <p>In Madison, I have tried numerous restaurants and have narrowed it down to my top 5 to mention here. They are as follows:</p>

    <table style="width:40%">
        <tr>
            <th style="width:15%">Restaurant</th>
            <th style="width:10%">Rating out of 10</th>
            <th style="width:15%">Favorite Dish</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Eno Vino</td>
            <td>9.5/10</td>
            <td>Wild Mushroom Risotto</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
