<h2>Travel</h2>

<p>I love to travel and have been fortunate to live in major cities in between my travels.
    I have included images and descriptions of a few of my favorite trips on this site.
</p>
    
    <h3>My Home Cities</h3>
    <h4>Chicago, Illinois</h4>
    <p>I live in Chicago part-time with my mom. I love the city - it feels manageable while still being a hub of culture. There is always something to do.</p>
    <p>I love to go running on the Lakefront path, try new restaurants, and go shopping.</p>

    <h4>New York, New York</h4>
    <p>I live in New York part-time with my dad. This is my favorite city of all time.</p>
    <p>It truly has a feel like nowhere else on earth.</p>

    <h4>Washington, D.C.</h4>
    <p>I also spend part of my time in Washington, D.C., with my dad.</p>
    <p>As our nation's capital city, it is lively and never has a lack of exciting things going on.</p>

    <h3>Ireland</h3>
    <p>I visited Ireland in 2023. My dad's side of the family is all from there, and it was so amazing to connect with my heritage.</p>
    <p>Some of our family live on a farm there, so I got to meet real animals which was an experience unlike any other.</p>
    <p>Furthermore, Ireland has such a rich culture through music, food, its main cities, and more. I adored this trip.</p>

    <h3>Lisbon</h3>
    <p>I visited Lisbon in 2022. Located in the country of Portugal, Lisbon is a major city that is filled with incredible history.</p>
    <p>I explored old castles with my family, as well as went on long walks exploring the city. I would highly recommend visiting Lisbon.</p>
