<h2>Running</h2>

<h3>My Running Story</h3>
<p>I began running, like many other people, during quarantine when the gyms were closed and I needed to find another way to workout.</p>
<p>I fell in love with running for the way that it made me feel.</p>
<p>This is not to say that it came easily to me at first. I had to have a lot of grit to get used to running for a prolonged period of time.</p>

<p>Once I began running 6+ miles consistently, running became an important part of my life. I ran long distance in track in high school, running the mile and the two mile race.</p>
<p>Now in college, though I don't run for a team, I continue to do so because of the benefits that it has for both my physical and my mental health.</p>
<p>I am planning on running a marathon in the next year - stay tuned!</p>

<h3>How I Track my Runs</h3>
<p> I use the app <a href="https://www.strava.com/">Strava</a> to track my runs. </p>
<p> Strava is helpful for a number of reasons - I get all kinds of statistics on my pace, heart rate, and elevation.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it allows me to connect with friends. You can give "kudos" to cheer someone on after they have uploaded their run, which is a feature that I love.</p>
<p>Below is an example of a run that I tracked on Strava.</p>
